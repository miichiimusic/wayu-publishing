A **Performing Rights Organization (PRO)** is an entity that helps songwriters, composers, and music publishers get paid when their music is performed publicly. Whether your song is played on the radio, streamed on Spotify, used in a restaurant, or performed live at a venue, a PRO ensures you're compensated for that use.

If you’re writing or composing music—whether for your own project or for others—joining a PRO is one of the most important steps you can take to start collecting income from your work.

## What Does a PRO Do?

A PRO monitors and collects **performance royalties** on behalf of songwriters and publishers. These royalties are generated when your music is:

- Broadcast on **radio** or **TV**
- Streamed on platforms like **Spotify**, **Apple Music**, or **YouTube**
- Performed **live** at venues, festivals, clubs, or public events
- Played in **restaurants**, **gyms**, **hotels**, **stores**, and other public spaces

Rather than chasing each individual business or platform for payment, PROs issue **blanket licenses** to these entities. Those licenses give them the legal right to play any music in the PRO’s catalog—and the revenue from those licenses is distributed as royalties to registered songwriters and publishers.

## Key PROs Around the World

Each country usually has one or more designated PROs. Here are a few examples:

- **United States**:  
  - **ASCAP** (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers)  
  - **BMI** (Broadcast Music, Inc.)  
  - **SESAC** (by invitation only)  
  - **GMR** (Global Music Rights)

- **United Kingdom**:  
  - **PRS for Music**

- **Canada**:  
  - **SOCAN**

- **Germany**:  
  - **GEMA**

- **Mexico**:  
  - **SACM**

Each of these organizations functions similarly but may differ in terms of registration, payouts, and international reach.

## Who Should Join a PRO?

If you’re a:

- **Songwriter or composer** – You need to join as a **writer member** to collect your share of performance royalties.
- **Publisher** or self-published artist – You should also create a **publisher account** to collect the publishing share of performance royalties.

Most PROs split performance royalties 50/50:
- **50% to the songwriter**
- **50% to the publisher**

If you haven’t registered as a publisher, that 50% may go unclaimed.

## How Do PROs Track Music Use?

PROs use a combination of technology and reporting to track performances:

- **Radio and television monitoring**
- **Digital fingerprinting** on streaming services
- **Cue sheets** from film and TV productions
- **Setlist submissions** from touring artists
- **Reports** from venues, festivals, and businesses

As a writer, it’s important to **submit your works** to your PRO and report your own live performances (often called “setlists” or “live performance claims”) to get paid for your gigs.

## PROs vs. Other Royalty Organizations

While PROs focus on **performance royalties**, they do not collect:

- **Mechanical royalties** – These are collected by organizations like **The MLC** (in the U.S.) or **MCPS** (in the UK).
- **Master royalties** – These are paid to the owner of the sound recording via **distributors** like DistroKid, TuneCore, etc.

So even if you're registered with a PRO, you may still be missing out on other types of royalties unless your catalog is fully registered with the appropriate agencies.

## Why Joining a PRO Is Essential

Joining a PRO is often the **first step** toward turning your music into a reliable source of income. It ensures that every time your song is played in public—no matter the format—you get paid. PROs also provide:

- Quarterly or semi-annual royalty payouts
- Access to performance data and analytics
- Opportunities for grants, showcases, or sync placements (varies by PRO)
- Support with rights disputes or claims

## How to Join

Joining a PRO is straightforward. Most allow you to register online. Here’s what you’ll need:

- Your legal name and contact info  
- Tax information (e.g., SSN or EIN for U.S. residents)  
- Bank account for direct deposit  
- Optional: Create a publishing entity if you want to collect the publisher share

Once you’ve joined, you can begin registering your works and submitting performance reports.

**Final Thought**  
If you’ve written even one original song that’s been played or performed publicly, you could be owed royalties. Don’t leave money on the table—register with a PRO and make sure your work is tracked, protected, and paid.
